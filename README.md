## hi, i'm iris
A Master's Student studying Data Science at the University of Barcelona

I'm currently working on my master's thesis on fairness-aware machine learning models using the MIMIC-IV dataset.

I'm interested in how data science can improve and provide support in fields like: healthcare, sustainability, and education.

On my GitHub page, I have projects from my coursework at UB as well as some personal projects.

Core tools:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning & Data Analysis
- Fairness in AI & Responsible AI
- Data visualization & research
