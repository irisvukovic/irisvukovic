## hi, i'm iris
A Master's Student studying Data Science at the University of Barcelona

I'm currently working on my master's thesis on fairness-aware machine learning models in healthcare on the MIMIC-IV dataset.
I'm interested in how data science can intersect with and provide support in fields like healthcare, sustainability, and education.

On my GitHub page, I have projects from my coursework at UB as well as some personal projects.
